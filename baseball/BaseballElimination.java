 * Description:
 * In the baseball elimination problem, there is a division consisting of n
 * teams. At some point during the season, team i has w[i] wins, l[i] losses,
 * r[i] remaining games, and g[i][j] games left to play against team j.
 * A team is mathematically eliminated if it cannot possibly finish the season
 * in (or tied for) first place. The goal is to determine exactly which teams
 * are mathematically eliminated. For simplicity, we assume that no games end
 * in a tie (as is the case in Major League Baseball) and that there are no
 * rainouts (i.e., every scheduled game is played).
 * The problem is not as easy as many sports writers would have you believe, in
 * part because the answer depends not only on the number of games won and left
 * to play, but also on the schedule of remaining games.
 *
 * A maxflow formulation.
 * We can solve the baseball elimination problem by reducing it to the maxflow
 * problem. To check whether team x is eliminated, we consider two cases.
 * - Trivial elimination. If the maximum number of games team x can win is less
 * than the number of wins of some other team i, then team x is trivially
 * eliminated. That is, if w[x] + r[x] < w[i], then team x is mathematically
 * eliminated.
 * - Nontrivial elimination. Otherwise, we create a flow network and solve a
 * maxflow problem in it. In the network, feasible integral flows correspond to
 * outcomes of the remaining schedule. There are vertices corresponding to teams
 * (other than team x) and to remaining divisional games (not involving team x).
 * Intuitively, each unit of flow in the network corresponds to a remaining
 * game. As it flows through the network from s to t, it passes from a game
 * vertex, say between teams i and j, then through one of the team vertices i
 * or j, classifying this game as being won by that team.
 *
 * More precisely, the flow network includes the following edges and capacities:
 * - We connect an artificial source vertex s to each game vertex i-j and set
 * its capacity to g[i][j]. If a flow uses all g[i][j] units of capacity on
 * this edge, then we interpret this as playing all of these games, with the
 * wins distributed between the team vertices i and j.
 * - We connect each game vertex i-j with the two opposing team vertices to
 * ensure that one of the two teams earns a win. We do not need to restrict the
 * amount of flow on such edges.
 * - Finally, we connect each team vertex to an artificial sink vertex t. We want
 * to know if there is some way of completing all the games so that team x ends
 * up winning at least as many games as team i. Since team x can win as many
 * as w[x] + r[x] games, we prevent team i from winning more than that many
 * games in total, by including an edge from team vertex i to the sink vertex
 * with capacity w[x] + r[x] - w[i].
 * If all edges in the maxflow that are pointing from s are full, then this
 * corresponds to assigning winners to all of the remaining games in such a way
 * that no team wins more games than x. If some edges pointing from s are not
 * full, then there is no scenario in which team x can win the division.
 *
 * What the min cut tells us.
 * By solving a maxflow problem, we can determine whether a given team is
 * mathematically eliminated. We would also like to explain the reason for the
 * team's elimination to a friend in nontechnical terms (using only grade-school
 * arithmetic). In fact, when a team is mathematically eliminated there always
 * exists such a convincing certificate of elimination, where R is some subset
 * of the other teams in the division. Moreover, you can always find such a
 * subset R by choosing the team vertices on the source side of a min s-t cut
 * in the baseball elimination network. Note that although we solved a
 * maxflow/mincut problem to find the subset R, once we have it, the argument
 * for a team's elimination involves only grade-school algebra.
 *
 * Corner cases.
 * The last six methods throw an IllegalArgumentException if one (or both) of
 * the input arguments are invalid teams.
 *
 * We assume that n â‰¥ 1 and that the input files are in the specified format
 * and internally consistent. Note that a team's number of remaining games does
 * not necessarily equal the sum of the remaining games against teams in its
 * division because a team may play opponents outside its division.
